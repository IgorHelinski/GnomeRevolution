# GnomeRevolution
Little game for GMTK 2023 game jam
Theme: roles reversed
Title of the game: Gnome Revolution

The little gnomes in your computer are bored of rendering the game for you so you instead take the role of processing the game for them by dragging and dropping their input, managing memory and fixing any bugs on fly. You need to be quick to not drop down their framerate, keeping them happy
